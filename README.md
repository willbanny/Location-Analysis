# Location-Analysis
Final Project repo - Location Analysis project

- best to start with very simple set of features (pure Google API?) and do an initial K means? Develop out from there with extra features

### Steps:

1. Data collection/sourcing
2. Create ETL packages for these sources and put into database
3. Create database map for relationships between different datasets
4. Create a final clean dataset to use for model
5. Test out different unsupervised clustering models and analyse results
6. Refactor code and improve results by adding features etc!
